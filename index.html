<p>Visit our website @ http://www.nandotech.com</p>

<p>We center all our work and philosophy around principles of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Focus

<ul>
<li>Because we focus on only a few things at a time, we work well together and produce excellent work. We deliver valuable items sooner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Courage

<ul>
<li>Because we work as a team, we feel supported and have more resources at our disposal. This gives us the courage to undertake greater challenges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Openness

<ul>
<li>As we work together, we express how we're doing, what's in our way, and our concerns so they can be addressed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commitment

<ul>
<li>Because we have great control over our own destiny, we are more committed to success.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Respect

<ul>
<li>As we work together, sharing successes and failures, we come to respect each other and to help each other become worthy of respect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Transparency

<ul>
<li><strong>Both internally and with clients</strong></li>
<li>Work should be visible for the client and team</li>

</li>
<li>Customer collaboration is valued over contract negotiation</li>

<hr>

<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:</p>

<p><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools
<strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation
<strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation
<strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</p>

<p>That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>

<a id="principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto" class="anchor" href="#principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Principles behind the Agile Manifesto</h2>

<p>We follow these principles:
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.</p>

<p>Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
development. Agile processes harness change for 
the customer's competitive advantage.</p>

<p>Deliver working software frequently, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
preference to the shorter timescale.</p>

<p>Business people and developers must work 
together daily throughout the project.</p>

<p>Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the job done.</p>

<p>The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation.</p>

<p>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</p>

<p>Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</p>

<p>Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility.</p>

<p>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
of work not done--is essential.</p>

<p>The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
emerge from self-organizing teams.</p>

<p>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.</p>
