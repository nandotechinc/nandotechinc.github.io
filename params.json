  "body": "### Welcome to NandoTech, Inc's Github Home\r\nWe center all our work and philosophy around principles of:\r\n* Focus\r\n   - Because we focus on only a few things at a time, we work well together and produce excellent work. We deliver valuable items sooner.\r\n* Courage\r\n    - Because we work as a team, we feel supported and have more resources at our disposal. This gives us the courage to undertake greater challenges.\r\n* Openness\r\n    - As we work together, we express how we're doing, what's in our way, and our concerns so they can be addressed\r\n* Commitment\r\n    - Because we have great control over our own destiny, we are more committed to success.\r\n* Respect\r\n    - As we work together, sharing successes and failures, we come to respect each other and to help each other become worthy of respect.\r\n\r\n### In order to accomplish this, we make extensive use of\r\n* Transparency\r\n   - **Both internally and with clients**\r\n   - Work should be visible for the client and team\r\n* Customer collaboration is valued over contract negotiation\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Manifesto for Agile Software Development\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nWe are uncovering better ways of developing\r\nsoftware by doing it and helping others do it.\r\nThrough this work we have come to value:\r\n\r\n**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools\r\n**Working software** over comprehensive documentation\r\n**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation\r\n**Responding to change** over following a plan\r\n\r\nThat is, while there is value in the items on\r\nthe right, we value the items on the left more.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto\r\n\r\nWe follow these principles:\r\nOur highest priority is to satisfy the customer\r\nthrough early and continuous delivery\r\nof valuable software.\r\n\r\nWelcome changing requirements, even late in \r\ndevelopment. Agile processes harness change for \r\nthe customer's competitive advantage.\r\n\r\nDeliver working software frequently, from a \r\ncouple of weeks to a couple of months, with a \r\npreference to the shorter timescale.\r\n\r\nBusiness people and developers must work \r\ntogether daily throughout the project.\r\n\r\nBuild projects around motivated individuals. \r\nGive them the environment and support they need, \r\nand trust them to get the job done.\r\n\r\nThe most efficient and effective method of \r\nconveying information to and within a development \r\nteam is face-to-face conversation.\r\n\r\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress.\r\n\r\nAgile processes promote sustainable development. \r\nThe sponsors, developers, and users should be able \r\nto maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\r\n\r\nContinuous attention to technical excellence \r\nand good design enhances agility.\r\n\r\nSimplicity--the art of maximizing the amount \r\nof work not done--is essential.\r\n\r\nThe best architectures, requirements, and designs \r\nemerge from self-organizing teams.\r\n\r\nAt regular intervals, the team reflects on how \r\nto become more effective, then tunes and adjusts \r\nits behavior accordingly.\r\n",
